# Introduction
This assignment tests your ability to create an interactive Augmented Reality based experience using Unity 3D and Vuforia. *"COVID_UNLOADED"* is a game I created where Coronavirus spores are rotating around each other at different speeds using Visual Studio to alter the code, this code will then move my 3D models.

# Description
*"COVID_UNLOADED"* is an example of an augmented reality art game that is developed with Unity3D using the Vuforia software engine. The theme of the game is based surrounding the Coronavirus pandemic. The user can download an APK file that I previously built within the Unity engine. You could also use a QR code, this opens the URL embedded in the QR code. The user must continue to scan the same QR code & see the 3D model/animation appear on top of it (a target image is also provided). Keep in mind that a QR scanner is built-in in the camera of some Android/iPhones, so some users wouldn't have to download the app for it! When the camera recognizes the marker, the app will render the Covid spores (Virions) rotating around each other at different speeds and angles. This continuously happens in a loop. There is also an opening screen that entails of instructions on how to use the application with a guided hint. 

# Requirements
### Technical
- You are required to create an interactive solution using the Unity3D authoring environment.
- You must publish your work in a private repository on GitHub.
- You must package your application for: **Android Mobile**.

# Installation
### Unity

*Unity* is a cross-platform game engine for creating games in both 2D and 3D. Unity supports building games for many platforms such as iOS, Android, Windows, PlayStation, Oculus Rift and many more. Ensure to select Android build support and Vuforia Augmented Reality support.

### Vuforia

*Unity* integrates the *Vuforia* engine, making it even easier to create cutting edge augmented reality experiences for both handheld and headworn devices. *Vuforia* engine is a software platform for creating Augmented Reality apps. Developers can easily add advanced computer vision functionality to any application, allowing it to recognize images and objects, and interact with spaces in the real world.
