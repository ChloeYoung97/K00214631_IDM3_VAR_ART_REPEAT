# Introduction
This assignment tests your ability to create an interactive Augmented Reality based experience using Unity 3D and Vuforia. *"COVID_UNLOADED"* is a game I created where Coronavirus spores are rotating around each other at different speeds using Visual Studio to alter the code, this code will then move my 3D models.

# Description
*"COVID_UNLOADED"* is an example of an augmented reality art game that is developed with Unity3D using the Vuforia software engine. The theme of the game is based surrounding the Coronavirus pandemic. The user can download an APK file that I previously built within the Unity engine. You could also use a QR code, this opens the URL embedded in the QR code. The user must continue to scan the same QR code & see the 3D model/animation appear on top of it (a target image is also provided). Keep in mind that a QR scanner is built-in in the camera of some Android/iPhones, so some users wouldn't have to download the app for it! When the camera recognizes the marker, the app will render the Covid spores (Virions) rotating around each other at different speeds and angles. This continuously happens in a loop. There is also an opening screen that entails of instructions on how to use the application with a guided hint. 

# Requirements
### Technical
- You are required to create an interactive solution using the Unity3D authoring environment.
- You must publish your work in a private repository on GitHub.
- You must package your application for: **Android Mobile**.

# Installation
### Unity

*Unity* is a cross-platform game engine for creating games in both 2D and 3D. Unity supports building games for many platforms such as iOS, Android, Windows, PlayStation, Oculus Rift and many more. Ensure to select Android build support and Vuforia Augmented Reality support.

**Installing Unity is as easy as following these simple steps with the link allocated below:**

### Vuforia

*Unity* integrates the *Vuforia* engine, making it even easier to create cutting edge augmented reality experiences for both handheld and headworn devices. *Vuforia* engine is a software platform for creating Augmented Reality apps. Developers can easily add advanced computer vision functionality to any application, allowing it to recognize images and objects, and interact with spaces in the real world.

**Installing Vuforia is as easy as following this simple video with the link allowcated below:**

### Installing an APK file

#### *Preparing Your Android Device*
Since your phone considers any application outside of Google Play as an "unknown app", you need to tell your phone to allow you to install unknown apps.

*ENABLE INSTALLING "UNKNOWN APPS" ON ANDROID NOUGAT*
1. Go into **Settings**.
2. Tap **Security** (or **Lock Screen & Security**).
3. Scroll down to the **Device Administration** section and enable **Unknown Sources**.

*ENABLE INSTALLING "UNKNOWN APPS" ON ANDROID OREO*
1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Then **Apps & Notifications**.
3. Select **Install Unknown Apps** (or **Install Other Apps**).

***(You may need to find your mobile device type online if both of these solutions don't suffice).***

#### *Install an Android File Manager*
Now that you have configured your phone to let you install unknown apps, you'll also need a way to find that application file (APK file) on your phone so you can run it.

Android phones typically come with a "File Manager" app that you can use. But if you don't have one, then open Google Play on your phone and search for "File Manager". You'll see lots of options available.

Some of the best options include:
- <ins>Cx File Explorer</ins>
- <ins>EZ File Explorer</ins>
- <ins>File Manager</ins>

Install any of these file managers so you'll be able to locate the APK file after you've transferred it to your phone.

#### *Easiest: Download the APK Installer From Your Android*
The easiest way to install an APK file on your Android is to download the file using your Android Browser.

1. I will be providing this said link within the resources section of this documentation. Click on the APK link. You may see a pop-up asking if you want to let your mobile download this "unknown file" with "This type of file can harm your device".
2. Just click **OK** to continue.
3. If your phone's web browser doesn't give you the option to option to open the file after downloading, then open the file explorer app you installed, and go to the Downloads folder on your device.
4. Tap the **APK file**. Allow the app any required permissions it asks for. Then, at the bottom of the installer window, click **INSTALL**.
5. You'll see a confirmation the app is installed. Now you'll see the app available in your list of installed apps.

# **Concept Development**
> Using YouTube, Facebook, Unity assets store, SketchFab as well as communicating with
> other friends and collegues I gathered many different
>  concepts for this AR experience in the early development stages.
> This project is a concept piece __**ONLY**__. This AR experience isn't too
> complicated, keeping this simple will allow more so for the developer
> to  understand how an AR experience is developed with Unity using the Vuforia engine platform.
> This is all 3rd party content used within this AR experience (excluding C# scripting).

# **Acknologements**
>*John Jennings* lecturer head over Virtual & Augmented Reality for IDM3.
>Inspiration.
> I would like to thank many wonderful YouTube channels for helping me lay down the foundations for my project
> I would like to thank any collogues, family members etc who helped with my project in the early to late stage development that kept up motivation to complete this project.
